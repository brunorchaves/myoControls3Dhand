# Gesture Classification and 3D Hand Control

## Overview

This repository is part of a project aimed at training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using EMG data from Myo armbands. The trained model classifies hand gestures and controls a 3D hand model in Unity using the Hand Gesture Recognition library by Mediapipe.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- [Pyomyo](https://github.com/danielbarteit/pyomyo) (version 1.0.4)
- [Hand Gesture Recognition Mediapipe](https://github.com/<mediapipe-repo-owner>/hand-gesture-recognition-mediapipe) (replace `<mediapipe-repo-owner>` with the actual owner's username)

Additionally, the Unity project associated with this repository can be found [here](<link-to-unity-project>).

## Usage

1. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
